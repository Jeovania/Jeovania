### Hi, folks! Zup? 👋 

I'm **Jeovania** (or Jeo) and I work as a front-end engineer for as long as I can remember. Love the web, but I flirt with mobile from time to time. 😏 📱

- 🏢  Working at [iFood](https://ifood.com.br)

- 😄  Pronouns: She/Her

- 🌱  I’m currently learning more about accessibility and how to help all people have access to this wonderful, and sometimes scary, place called the internet.

- ⚡  Fun fact: My name has an uncommon spelling so I can have my first name as username on most platforms. Just like Madonna or Cher, but much less glamorous. ✨
